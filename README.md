# MyMatrix
MyMatrix header file that allows for matrix resizing, access and multiplication.

This header file contains:
  
  Default constructor, parameterized constructor and copy constructor to create an 
instance of matrix which can be used as an object.
  
  Functions that allow the creation of an object of type matrix and use the .at() 
and () operator to access specific positions in the matrix.

  Functions that allow to grow the size of the matrix with the help of a helper 
function that specifcally grows columns and thus allows to resize a matrix whose 
size has already been initialized.

  Functions that allow the use of * operator to multiply two matrices as we would
in mathematics and return a matrice with the solution.
